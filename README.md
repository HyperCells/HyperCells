# The GAP package HyperCells

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10782370.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10782370)

HyperCells is a [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) package that allows
constructing primitive cells and supercells of hyperbolic lattices based on
triangle groups and quotients with normal subgroups.

:book: We have a new website with detailed [instructions on the installation](https://www.hypercells.net/contents/Installation/installation.html) process, a [getting-strated guide](https://www.hypercells.net/contents/GettingStarted/getting_started.html) and hands-on [tutorials](https://www.hypercells.net/contents/Tutorials/tutorials.html): https://www.hypercells.net.

An introduction to the underlying concepts can be found in the following preprint

## Installation

To install the HyperCells package, clone this repository in the `~/.gap/pkg/`
directory.
GAP should automatically detect the package and make it available for loading
using the command
```GAP
LoadPackage("HyperCells");
```

### Extensions (optional)

The HyperCells package has an integrated word simplification procedure for a selection
 of functions. Two methods are available: a default brute-force method, and a method based 
on the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm. The latter can only be used provided the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://gap-packages.github.io/kbmag/doc/chap0_mj.html">kbmag</a> 
package (version 1.5.10+) is available. 

The default configuration of the kbmag package allows HyperCells to simplify words in groups 
with a maximal number of generators of 127. However, this limit can manually be extended up to 
65535. The corresponding adjustments are laid out in a README file in the kbmag package and can 
be found in the folder containing GAP: “…/gap/gap-< version >/pkg/kbmag/standalone”, with the 
following instructions:

```
NEW in Version 2.3: It is now possible to use kbmag with more than the
previous default number of 127 generators. To use up to 65535 generators,
before making the package, edit the file "defs.h" in the lib directory,
and change the two lines:

#define MAXGEN MAXCHAR /* maximum number of generators */
typedef char gen; /* for generators of monoids and groups */

to

#define MAXGEN MAXUSHORT /* maximum number of generators */
typedef unsigned short gen; /* for generators of monoids and groups */
```

Once these changes are made, kbmag needs to be recompiled. This can be done in the terminal, 
where in the kbmag directory one needs to execute the command **make clean** and afterwards **make**.

If these changes are not made while using the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm based simplification 
and unit cells compactified on Riemann surfaces with genus exceeding 63 are used, the procedure will 
not be executed and a warning will be printed in GAP:

```
#WARNING: maximal number of generators have been exceeded; non-simplified words 
will be used. Please follow the instructions in the chapter Introduction section
Simplify extension (optional) in the HyperCells reference manual.
```

## Documentation

The documentation is available on the accompanying Github pages website.

## Limitations
Note that at this point *HyperCells* is still under development and, because the
limitations have not yet been fully determined, released only as a beta version.
Further testing will be required before an official release. However, the package
is already fully functional and documented and can be used to reproduce the results
of the publication mentioned above.

### Known limitations
- `TGCellGraph` objects and symmetric `TGCell` objects cannot be produced for
  cells without mirror symmetries, i.e., for quotients that act "chirally" on
  the surface.

## HyperBloch package

The HyperBloch package is a companion package to HyperCells for Mathematica.
It allows to study the band structure of hyperbolic lattices by applying hyperbolic
band theory and the supercell method. Additionally, it provides many functions
to visualize the output of HyperCells. It is available on Github at
> [https://github.com/HyperCells/HyperBloch](https://github.com/HyperCells/HyperBloch)
